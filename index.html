            <h3>Key Insights & Recommendations</h3>
            
            <h4>Shot Distribution</h4>
            <p>Mabrey's shot distribution reflects a perimeter-oriented offensive role, with a high concentration of attempts from three-point range and minimal reliance on mid-range shots.</p>
            
            <h4>Perimeter Efficiency</h4>
            <p>She demonstrates strong efficiency from specific three-point zones, particularly in corner and catch-and-shoot areas, making her a reliable spacing option in half-court offense.</p>
            
            <h4>Interior Efficiency</h4>
            <p>Despite limited volume, she demonstrates elite efficiency at the rim (as evidenced by the dense concentration of makes in both seasons), suggesting significant untapped value in creating driving lanes and cut-based opportunities to complement her perimeter game.</p>
            
            <h4>Shot Selection Discipline</h4>
            <p>Limited mid-range volume aligns with analytically efficient shot selection, avoiding historically low-value areas of the floor.</p>
            
            <h4>Operational Recommendation</h4>
            <p>Optimal usage emphasizes perimeter spacing and off-ball movement, while selectively incorporating interior actions to capitalize on defensive rotations and her elite rim-finishing ability rather than increasing low-efficiency mid-range attempts.</p>

        <div class="analysis">
            <h3>Season-Over-Season Comparison (2024 vs 2025)</h3>
            
            <h4>Significant Performance Decline</h4>
            <p>Mabrey experienced a substantial decrease in shooting efficiency between the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Her overall field goal percentage dropped from 41.3% to 36.7%, with her three-point shooting declining sharply from 37.7% to 27.0%—a 10.7 percentage point decrease that falls well below league-average efficiency.</p>
            
            <h4>Shot Volume and Distribution Shifts</h4>
            <p>Total shot attempts decreased from 518 in 2024 to 488 in 2025, suggesting a reduced offensive role. Despite lower volume, her shot selection philosophy remained consistent—maintaining a perimeter-oriented approach with minimal mid-range activity. Notably, her two-point percentage actually improved slightly (45.0% to 46.3%), indicating maintained efficiency on interior attempts when created.</p>
            
            <h4>Spatial Efficiency Changes</h4>
            <p>The hexbin efficiency maps reveal critical spatial differences. In 2024, Mabrey displayed multiple elite shooting zones (red hexagons) throughout the three-point arc, particularly in corners and wings. The 2025 map shows a dramatic reduction in elite-efficiency zones, with primarily below-average (blue) hexagons across the perimeter and only isolated hot spots remaining at the rim and in select corner positions.</p>
            
            <h4>Contextual Factors</h4>
            <p>Mabrey played her first full season with Connecticut in 2025 after being traded mid-season in 2024. The efficiency decline likely reflects multiple factors: system adjustment, role changes within a more talent-dense roster (Connecticut was a playoff contender), and potentially increased defensive attention as opponents adjusted to her tendencies.</p>
            
            <h4>Operational Implications</h4>
            <p>While the 2025 decline is concerning, several positive indicators remain: (1) maintained shot discipline avoiding low-value mid-range attempts, (2) strong rim efficiency when opportunities arise, and (3) volume suggesting continued trust from coaching staff despite struggles. For 2026 roster decisions, teams should evaluate whether this represents genuine skill regression or a temporary adjustment period. Her 2024 performance demonstrates higher-level capability, suggesting potential bounce-back value for organizations willing to invest in role optimization and rhythm development.</p>
